KPAW is an api wrapper for PenguinMod made for python.

I made this module because PenguinMod doesn't really have a public API

## So how do I use this?
Go view the wiki to show you how to set up kpaw and how to use it!

## So how did you get the API links?
A little thing called inspect :)

## Whats the point?
To have fun exploring what you can do with this API wrapper! You can grab pfps, follow people, Like, Vote/Favorite, and more!
